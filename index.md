I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Geography and Environment](http://www.abdn.ac.uk/geosciences/departments/geography-environment/) at the [University of Aberdeen](http://www.abdn.ac.uk/). My current research interest include:

* Connections between the **built environment and health**, particularly environmental factors that influence physical activity and active mode choice
* Non-work and multi-purpose travel dynamics, in particular the journey to school and food travel
* Using **GPS, accelerometer, smartphone, and mobile devices** to study **travel behavior**
* The effectiveness of programs and policies aimed at **promoting the shift towards active travel modes**

I also [build](http://tourdefarmsbuffalo.org/#Map) [web maps](http://www.nydropboxes.org) and support [Arsenal FC](http://www.arsenal.com).
